We are an extralegal entity, a break-away society of racially aware white men.

We have chosen to drop off the grid into the underground economy and live outside of the authority of nation states. By extension, since many nation states are appendages of the globalist agenda, we are also breaking free of the globalist power structure. This includes the unelected power of academic, religious, political and corporate elites.

This national and international power structure is hereinafter referred to simply as "the system".

Independence from the system demands we provide for ourselves such things as we now rely upon the system to provide for us. We are thus committed to the task of developing our own parallel structures to those of the system. This includes but is not limited to banking, media, transportation, communication, shipping, agriculture, energy, medicine and technological development. Additionally we will constantly seek out new and creative ways of exploiting system blind spots in order to use its infrastructure for our own purposes.

Our goal is unabashed self interest, pursued outside the restrictions and laws of the system. We want self determination, power and material wealth for ourselves. We will pursue our self interest in such manner as benefits WHITE society and at the same time undermines the system. We will do this by facilitating, through our various networks, other people's (read: other WHITE people's) ability to drop out with us. This will further deprive the system of white tax dollars and white labor.

CHARACTER
---------

We hold that people who have no vices also have very few virtues. Our ideal, unlike many other "racially aware" circles, is NOT the wholesome, clean-cut, born again Christian who doesn't smoke or curse or do anything else "degenerate". Our ideal is Tyler Durden who fights and fucks and who sells rich women their own fat asses back to them. Our aspirational figure is the sigma male.

We develop our character through dangerous and sometimes subversive acts such as

1. Random violence against the person and property of local gangs, criminals, violent refugees and cucks. (Wear a fucking ski-mask dummy)

2. Acts of theft against the same. They gorge themselves on our welfare system like parasites or, in the case of pro-immigrant cucks, they enable and defend these parasites. Their property is rightfully ours for the taking.

3. Extreme and dangerous sports

4. Any legally questionable thrill-seeking such as urban exploration

5. Property destruction of corporations or any other institutions that you deem in your sole discretion to be working in favor of SYSTEM interests and against WHITE interests.

Some of these acts serve a revolutionary purpose in that they directly damage the system. But they are undertaken in the spirit of character development or "pathei-mathos" (google it you faggot). This turns them into a sustained effort of subversion instead of just a few feverish jabs at the system juggernaut before discouragement sets in.


SOCIAL STRUCTURE
----------------

Our online structure is that of an informal network, connected via anonymous chat services and encrypted email. No particular website, social media group or other permanent platform is our official headquarters. We will use various online platforms as needed and dispose of them once they outlive their usefulness. Whenever we happen to use a particular platform we stand ready to migrate to another one should we become the target of censorship, banning or infiltration. Online we will always remain unknown to one another except pseudonymously.

Our offline structure is the only place where we will personally know one another. We will form close-knit cells with local people who we personally trust. We will share skills, knowledge, energy and time to build a local power base and move off of the grid (aka drop out of the system).


ECONOMIC STRUCTURE
------------------

We will do our business with one another via cash, the best anonymous crypto currencies, prepaid cards and direct barter.

Such businesses as we create will span the white, grey and black market economies. They will include but are not limited to illicit darknet services and offline underground cottage industries. Some will serve no direct purpose to us besides profit (ie: illicit breweries). Others will serve our purposes more directly(ie: transporting goods), thereby circumventing the postal service and replacing part of the system.

We will distinguish these latter two types of businesses as profit-based and purpose-based respectively.

Our white market activity, be it a nine to five job or a registered business, will serve as a bland public face so as not to draw attention to ourselves from taxation authorities or of any other facet of the system. We will keep one foot in the white market world until such time as we have sufficient infrastructure to leave the system entirely.
