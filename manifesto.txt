We are a break-away society of racially aware white men. We are an extralegal, sovereign entity. We have chosen to drop off of the grid and live outside of the authority of nation states and be a law unto ourselves. By extension we are also breaking free of the globalist power structure. This includes the international power of academic, religious, political and corporate elites.

This national and international power structure is hereinafter referred to simply as "the System" or "System".

Independence from the System demands we provide for ourselves such things as we now rely upon the System to provide for us. We are thus committed to the task of developing our own parallel structures to those of the System. This includes but is not limited to banking, media, transportation, communication, shipping, agriculture, energy, medicine and technological development. Additionally we will constantly seek out new and creative ways of exploiting System blind spots in order to use its infrastructure for our own purposes.

Our goal is unabashed self interest pursued outside the restrictions and laws of the System. We want self determination, power and material wealth. We will pursue our self interest in such manner as benefits WHITE society and at the same time undermines the System. We will do this by facilitating, through our various networks, other people's (read: other WHITE people's) ability to drop out with us. This will further deprive the System of white tax dollars and white labor.

PERSONAL CHARACTER
------------------

We hold that people who have no vices also have very few virtues. Unlike many racially aware circles our ideal is NOT a wholesome, chaste, clean-cut individual who doesn't smoke or curse or do anything else "degenerate". We are not looking for moral puritans. We are looking for people who are able and willing to live outside the law, plain and simple.

We develop our character through dangerous and sometimes subversive acts. Namely:

1. Random violence and acts of theft against the person and property of local gangs, criminals, violent refugees and the cuck apologists who defend them.

2. Extreme and dangerous sports as well as illegal thrill-seeking such as urban exploration.

3. Property destruction of corporations or any other institutions that we deem in our sole discretion to be working in favor of System interests and against WHITE interests.

Some of these acts are directly subversive in that they directly damage the System. But they are undertaken in the spirit of character development or "pathei-mathos". This turns them into a sustained effort of subversion, not just a few feverish jabs at the System before discouragement sets in.


SOCIAL STRUCTURE
----------------

Our online structure is that of an informal network, connected via anonymous chat services and encrypted email. No particular website, social media group or other online platform is our official headquarters on the Internet. We will use various online platforms as needed and dispose of them once they outlive their usefulness. Whenever we happen to use a particular platform we stand ready to migrate to another one should we become the target of censorship, banning or infiltration. Online we will always remain unknown to one another except pseudonymously.

Our offline structure is the only place where we will personally know one another. We will form close-knit cells with local people who we personally trust. We will share skills, knowledge, energy and time to build a local power base and move off of the grid (aka drop out of the System).


ECONOMIC STRUCTURE
------------------

We will do our business with one another via cash, the best anonymous crypto currencies, prepaid cards and direct barter.

Such businesses as we create will span the white, grey and black market economies. They will include but are not limited to illicit darknet services and offline underground cottage industries. Some will serve only as a source of revenue (ie: illicit breweries) while others will serve our purposes more directly by replacing part of the System (ie: transporting/smuggling goods and circumventing the postal service).

Our white market activity, be it a nine to five job or a registered business, will serve as a bland public face so as not to draw attention to ourselves from taxation authorities or from any other facet of the System or from the general public. We will keep one foot in the white market world until such time as we have sufficient infrastructure to leave the System entirely.


PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
------------------

There have been two specific proposals thus far regarding our extact physical structure. The first has been to purchase land and erect a building to serve as our official headquarters. The second has been to purchase land for homesteading purposes, namely farming, though any sort of cottage industry that produces a livable wage would do just as well.

--ON OFFICIAL HEADQUARTERS

This manifesto holds that our modus operandi is one of decentralization, compartmentalization and anonymity. These principles must inform whatever physical structure our society takes in practice.

In this vein any sort of official headquarters, even a clandestine one, would be an enormous Achilles' heel. The risks of infiltration, subversion, instigation or betrayal far outweigh any possible benefits. The System holds the undisputed monopoly on centralized power and will work to undermine any independent power base. To confront it on that field would demand a level of fanatacism on par with the Church of Scientology.

We must utilize the negative space left over, the space of decentralized power and System blind spots. This means any "headquarters" such as there are would be localized, hosted in someone's home, attended by people who personally know each other and done under the guise of a weekend party. These localized cells would only speak to other cells via anonymous Internet channels and would never knowingly meet.

However we could create above-board, official groups for certain of our more innocuous activities and keep them compartmentalized from the rest of what we do. Homesteading Associations are one example. They can be an invaluable resource for networking, sharing experience and empowering people to become self-sufficient. We could start meetups, host events, rent out venues, even go as far as having our own official headquarters with dues-paying members. Or we could simply join pre-existing organizations and take advantage of the networking opportunities.

--ON HOMESTEADING

As to homesteading itself, of purchasing land and living off of it in a self-sufficient manner, it is certainly an option for those with opportunity to do so. People growing their own food are providing for themselves rather than relying on the factory farms and GMO products of the System. They are taking back their independence. If in addition to this they start their own cottage industries such as farmers markets, again they are helping replace part of the globalist system by producing locally. Homesteading can definitely be a valid part of our agenda.

But there are two things to bear in mind about homesteading:

1. We are meant to be a society, not just a collection of self-sufficient individuals who live outside the System. This means we actively work together, actively do business with one another and are self sufficient as an integrated society. Some people might grow food, some people might build wind turbines, some people might deliver goods between other people, etc. As stated in the first sentence of this manifesto, we are a break away society, not break-away individuals. Not everyone is going to be a homesteader. One could just as easily live in a city and run a business on the darknet.

2. Self-sufficiency is not the end-all and be-all of what we're about. We want self-determination, power, wealth, to replace the apparatus of the system with our own in ALL areas, to work for the general welfare of white society, and be a pro-active thorn in the side of the System in ways already described in the section on PERSONAL CHARACTER.
